# AI-Cancer Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and its early detection is critical for improving patient survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods often require expensive equipment, specialized skills, and time-consuming processes.

This project develops an AI-based Cancer Prediction System using patient datasets and machine learning models to predict the likelihood of cancer. The system is designed to assist healthcare professionals by providing faster and more reliable diagnostic support.

🎯 Objectives

Main Objective
Develop an AI system capable of predicting cancer likelihood using patient data, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment planning.

Specific Objectives

Collect and preprocess cancer patient datasets.

Perform feature engineering to identify relevant risk factors.

Train and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models.

Deploy a prototype system (Flask/Django web app).

Provide visual dashboards and reports to explain predictions.

Implement a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.

🏗️ AI Solution Outline
