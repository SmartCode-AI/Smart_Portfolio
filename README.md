📌 Project Overview

🎯 Problem Statement
Healthcare facilities in South Africa, especially in rural and peri-urban areas, struggle to provide timely and accurate diagnoses. The pressure on healthcare workers, scarce access to specialists, and reliance on manual triage methods lead to extended wait times for patients, delays in treatment, and a higher chance of misdiagnoses. Language barriers, incomplete medical records, and insufficient digital infrastructure further complicate these challenges. 

This issue is especially relevant to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). It highlights the importance of utilizing advanced technologies to tackle systemic problems. By integrating AI methods like machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition, healthcare systems can improve diagnostic assistance, prioritize urgent cases, and equip health professionals with instant insights.
